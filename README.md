**Amazon Bestsellers Analysis App** is an interactive web application in Python, built with **Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-learn, WordCloud, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. Based on the 100 most-read Amazon books from 1947 to 2023, this tool provides in-depth analysis of literary trends, including prices, ratings, and genre popularity.

With interactive charts, the app explores the relationship between price and ranking, top authors, and genre distribution. Additional features, like word clouds and cluster segmentation, offer a deep dive into Amazon's bestsellers.

Created for academic purposes, the **Amazon Bestsellers Analysis App** also highlights Streamlitâ€™s capabilities and limitations. The application enabled smooth integration with data libraries (and is set for testing with machine learning), despite the noted constraints in multithreading, parallelism, and some layout limitations. Recommended for small to medium web applications without multi-user requirements.
